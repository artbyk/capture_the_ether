## Description
I'm not going to solve all levels after ethernaut. I will solve only those that I can't solve in a certain time, when I spend a lot of time on solving. Or if I forgot something and can't solve it, or if the level taught me something new.

I will solve CTF challenges to keep myself sharp while studying other things.
